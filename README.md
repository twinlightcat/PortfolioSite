Progress is tracked in a GitHub Project  
[GitHub Project]([https://github.com/users/twinlightcat/projects/3/views/1](https://github.com/users/twinlightcat/projects/3/views/3?groupedBy%5BcolumnId%5D=189005342))

## Plan for site

Table of Contents
- Objective
- Background
- Implementation
- Technical

### Objective

Create a site that showcases my experience, knowledge and skills.
The portfolio site then itself becomes an item that can be looked at and inspected.

### Background

Over the years for my work, my GitHub has been either behind an Enterprise GitHub or a seperate private GitHub account.
Creating this to setup a public repository and public code.

### Implementation

Will implement this in stages working to get a minimum working product out first and then iterate and enhance the experience.

#### First Phase: Basic Site

Work on getting a single page resume sight with an intro section, brief experience, project, and about me.
Will also handle publishing this live for users to visit.

#### Second Phase: Application

Work on breaking apart the sections into different pages. Also bring in another new page of technology.
Going to extend out the functionality of the site adding in modals, animations, and extra styling flair.
From a technology aspect will bring in a cicd pipeline with linting and tests.

#### Third Phase: Infrastructure Stability

Move the application from a basic publishing site to deploying and operating on AWS.


### Technical

#### Frontend

Typical modern frontend application
- React.js
- Next.js
- TailwindCss

Supporting
- Eslint
- Cypress
- React Testing Library

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
