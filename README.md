### Objective

Create a site that showcases my experience, knowledge and skills. 
The portfolio site then itself becomes an item that can be looked at and inspected itelf in this repo.

### Background

Over the years for my work, my GitHub has been either behind an Enterprise GitHub or a seperate private GitHub account.
Creating this to setup a public repository and public code.

### Implementation

Will implement this in stages working to get a minimum working product out first and then iterate and enhance the experience.

#### First Phase Single Page

Work on getting a single page resume sight with an intro section, brief experience, project, and about me.

#### Second Phase Multi Navigation

Work on breaking apart the sections into different pages. Also bring in another new page of technology.
In this phase should also extend out the functionality of the site adding in modals, animations and extra styling flair
